    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='2737837' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 1:1-16</h2>
        <p> In this episode, I describe how the genealogy in Matthew is actually a  parody of a genealogy. In the gospel in which Jesus instructs his  followers to "call no one on earth 'father,'" this list of fathers is  intentionally ironic.</p>
        <p>I also talk about other "trickster" texts  in the Bible such as the praise of King Solomon and the story of the  rise of Joseph to the second most powerful person in Egypt. These  stories are not what they appear to be. </p>

    <p class="episodeCollapsible">Episode 2: The Virgin Birth</p>
    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='2889535' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 1:18-25</h2>
        <p> The "virgin birth" of Jesus, the title "Son of God," and the concept of the forgiveness of sins all had resonances in the first century Mediterranean world that they no longer have today. Understanding what those terms and concepts signaled, as well as how this story "fulfilled" the prophetic texts will greatly expand our understanding of what this story was all about.</p>

    <p class="episodeCollapsible">Episode 3: Matthew As Parody</p>
    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='2958949' player='true']</p>
        <p>This episode is the only one that will not look at one particular text (all the other episodes will continue progressively through Matthew), but rather at the book as a whole. I make the argument in this episode that the whole Gospel of Matthew parodies a genre in the ancient world to get across a very serious message.</p>

    <p class="episodeCollapsible">Episode 4: The Magi</p>
    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='3010498' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 2:1-12</h2>
        <p>The story of the Magi evokes sentimental, feel good memories of Christmas for many of us, but this story, for its original audience, signaled hopes of liberation from a brutal occupation.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="episodeCollapsible">Episode 5: The Flight into Egypt</p>
    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='3040882' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 2:13-18</h2>
        <p>In this episode, Jesus and his family become refugees. Fleeing their home country, which is under the brutal occupation of a foreign empire, they take refuge in Egypt, which, according to their national history, was both the place of their people's slavery and also a refuge for those escaping the Babylonian invasion.</p>
        <p>With this story, the author of Matthew introduces the themes of Jesus-as-Moses and Jesus-as-Israel by using Exodus imagery. The texts from Jeremiah 31 and Isaiah 53 also play an important role in setting up the gospel motif of Jesus bearing the suffering of his people.</p>

    <p class="episodeCollapsible">Episode 6: John the Baptizer</p>
    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='3067075' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 3:1-17</h2>
        <p> If this series has not been controversial already, it gets even more controversial in this episode. I make the claim that Jesus joins a liberation movement already in progress to get his start as "Messiah." Also I will assert that temples in the ancient world were government institutions that served as mechanisms through which the ruling classes controlled the people. A significant part of the movement of John the Baptizer was to undercut temple authority.</p>

    <div class="episodeContent">
        <p>[buzzsprout episode='3106231' player='true']</p>
        <h2>Matthew 4:1-11</h2>
        <p>In this episode, we follow Jesus through his "vision quest," as he retraces his people's journey in the wilderness through a time of testing/temptation. Jesus has to prove what sort of Messiah or "Son of God" he will be.</p>

        <h2>Matthew 4:12-22</h2>
        <p> Jesus takes up John's work of leading a movement for The New Society (Kingdom of Heaven). Matthew's imagery reminds the reader of the setting of this story in the Roman Empire. Jesus liberates his disciples from bondage to the empire, setting them free to join the movement.</p>

      <p>In this episode, to address our current situation, I take a break from Matthew and hop over to the Gospel of Luke to look at the Parable of the Dishonest Manager - A strange parable for strange times.

      <p>After having gathered in the lost - the tax/toll collectors and "sinners" - he suddenly gets called to a high status household, but on the way heals a marginalized woman suffering from menstrual bleeding. Chapters 8 and 9 have Jesus entering the worlds and lives of people who are very separate from each other: a leper, gentiles, women and men, social outcasts, low and high status people; in all of these situations, he brings healing, both social and physical. And finally he heals two blind men and casts out the demon from a mute man, punctuating this section of the story with images of liberation from Isaiah.</p>

      <p>Matthew has been showing how Jesus and his movement fulfill the visions of the prophets. In chapter 11, the fulfillment theme gets stated so forcefully that it becomes evident that Jesus does not merely fulfill the visions of the prophets but reinterprets them. This reinterpretation is part of a larger program of reinterpreting the world in a way that will change it for all who partake in this reinterpretation.</p>
